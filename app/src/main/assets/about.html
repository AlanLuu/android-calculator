                        This app also includes various code projects I've worked on during my spare time,
                        such as a sandbox with random primitive
                        shapes in a canvas, and a gravity simulator. There are also links to other projects
                        hosted on the web that I've included.
                        Feel free to ignore them.

                        An HTML canvas with a circle that follows the user's mouse cursor. The background
                        colors are
                        different depending on the time of day the user visits this website. The circle also
                        changes to
                        a random color every four seconds.

                        These things are all accomplished using JavaScript, jQuery, and CSS keyframes,
                        which are being used to switch between two slightly different background colors.

                        Patriotic Pirates: An educational web app where teachers can create multiplayer math
                        competitions.
                        Similar to Kahoot and Quizlet Live, students use their computer in order to
                        participate
                        in a game session. However, rather than consisting of a series of multiple choice
                        questions,
                        it provides free response questions where students must show their work in order to
                        support their answer. Teachers can evaluate the responses based on their explanation
                        and answer,
                        allowing them to better assess their students’ progress in the classroom. After the
                        game is
                        over, a leaderboard displays the top students’ name and score, promoting healthy
                        competition
                        among students.

                        For the frontend, the Desmos API is
                        utilized in this app in order to allow students to submit graphs, along with MathJax
                        to render beautiful math symbols in HTML, and LaTex for student and teacher input.
                        Node.js is used as the backend, along with Express.Js handling the routing of the
                        app’s webpage, and Socket.IO to allow participation from multiple students in a
                        single game session.
